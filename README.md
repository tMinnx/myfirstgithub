# myfirstgithub

What I would like to do for my first experience using Github and Github desktop.

It'd be an understatement programming confuses my language learning cells of the brain. I hope they can do whatever my natural language asks them to do without the need to learn all the syntax and error-prone command lines. I guess this sort of complexity gives programmers a chance to earn through this profession.
